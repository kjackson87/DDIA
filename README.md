## Project

Data Model and Storage Engine
Focus: Chapters 1-3
Task: Implement a simple key-value store with a basic storage engine.
Skills: File I/O, data structures, serialization
Data Encoding and Evolution
Focus: Chapter 4
Task: Extend the key-value store to support multiple data formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers, Avro) and implement schema evolution.
Skills: Data serialization, schema design, backward/forward compatibility
Replication and Partitioning
Focus: Chapters 5-6
Task: Transform the single-node key-value store into a distributed system with basic replication and partitioning.
Skills: Network programming, consistency models, partition strategies
Transactions and Consistency
Focus: Chapter 7
Task: Implement multi-key transactions and explore different isolation levels in the distributed key-value store.
Skills: Concurrency control, ACID properties, distributed transactions
Distributed System Challenges
Focus: Chapters 8-9
Task: Add fault tolerance, consensus algorithms, and batch/stream processing capabilities to the distributed key-value store.
Skills: Leader election, consensus protocols, batch and stream processing
Derived Data and Analytics
Focus: Chapters 10-12
Task: Implement a data pipeline that uses the distributed key-value store as a source, performs ETL operations, and loads data into an analytics-focused data store (e.g., a column-oriented store).
Skills: ETL processes, OLAP vs OLTP, data warehousing concepts
