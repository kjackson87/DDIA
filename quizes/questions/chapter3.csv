"What are the two main categories of storage engines discussed in the chapter?";"<p>The two main categories of storage engines discussed are:</p><ol><li>Storage engines optimized for transaction processing (OLTP)</li><li>Storage engines optimized for analytics (OLAP)</li></ol><p><i>(Reference: Transaction Processing or Analytics?, p. 90)</i></p>"
"What is a key difference between OLTP and OLAP in terms of data access patterns?";"<p>A key difference between OLTP and OLAP in terms of data access patterns is:</p><ul><li>OLTP systems typically process a large number of small operations, each touching a small amount of data</li><li>OLAP systems process fewer but larger operations that scan over a large portion of the dataset</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Transaction Processing or Analytics?, p. 90)</i></p>"
"What are the two main schools of thought for OLTP storage engines?";"<p>The two main schools of thought for OLTP storage engines are:</p><ol><li>The log-structured school (which only permits appending to files and deleting obsolete files)</li><li>The update-in-place school (which treats the disk as a set of fixed-size pages that can be overwritten)</li></ol><p><i>(Reference: Summary, p. 103)</i></p>"
"What is a key advantage of log-structured storage engines?";"<p>A key advantage of log-structured storage engines is:</p><ul><li>They turn random-access writes into sequential writes on disk, which enables higher write throughput due to the performance characteristics of hard drives and SSDs</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Summary, p. 103)</i></p>"
"What is a data warehouse and how does it differ from OLTP systems?";"<p>A data warehouse is:</p><ul><li>A separate database containing a read-only copy of data from OLTP systems, optimized for analytics</li></ul><p>It differs from OLTP systems in that:</p><ul><li>It's designed to handle complex queries that scan large portions of the dataset</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Data Warehousing, pp. 91-92)</i></p>"
"What is column-oriented storage and why is it beneficial for analytical queries?";"<p>Column-oriented storage is:</p><ul><li>A technique where data is stored by column rather than by row</li></ul><p>It's beneficial for analytical queries because:</p><ul><li>It allows the database to read only the columns needed for a query, reducing I/O and improving query performance</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Column-Oriented Storage, pp. 95-96)</i></p>"
"What is a B-tree and how does it differ from log-structured indexes?";"<p>A B-tree is:</p><ul><li>A self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time</li></ul><p>It differs from log-structured indexes in that:</p><ul><li>B-trees update data in-place, breaking the database down into fixed-size pages</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: B-Trees, pp. 79-80)</i></p>"
"What is write amplification and why is it a concern in storage systems?";"<p>Write amplification is:</p><ul><li>When a write to the database results in multiple writes to the disk over the course of the database's lifetime</li></ul><p>It's a concern because:</p><ul><li>It can reduce write throughput and cause faster wear on SSDs</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Comparing B-Trees and LSM-Trees, p. 84)</i></p>"
"What is a star schema in the context of data warehouses?";"<p>A star schema is:</p><ul><li>A data modeling technique used in data warehouses</li><li>It consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables, creating a star-like structure</li></ul><p>This schema:</p><ul><li>Simplifies queries and provides fast aggregations</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Stars and Snowflakes: Schemas for Analytics, pp. 93-95)</i></p>"
"What is a data cube and how does it relate to materialized views?";"<p>A data cube is:</p><ul><li>A multi-dimensional aggregation of data, pre-computing aggregates along various dimensions</li></ul><p>It relates to materialized views as follows:</p><ul><li>It's a special case of a materialized view, which is a cached result of a query</li><li>Data cubes can significantly speed up certain types of analytical queries</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Aggregation: Data Cubes and Materialized Views, pp. 101-102)</i></p>"
