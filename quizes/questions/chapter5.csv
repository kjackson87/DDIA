"What are the three main purposes of replication?";"<p>The three main purposes of replication are:</p><ol><li>High availability</li><li>Disconnected operation</li><li>Latency reduction</li></ol><p><i>(Reference: Introduction to Part II, p. 151)</i></p>"
"What are the three main approaches to replication discussed in the chapter?";"<p>The three main approaches to replication discussed in the chapter are:</p><ol><li>Single-leader replication</li><li>Multi-leader replication</li><li>Leaderless replication</li></ol><p><i>(Reference: Summary, p. 192)</i></p>"
"In single-leader replication, what is the role of the leader?";"<p>In single-leader replication, the role of the leader is to:</p><ul><li>Handle all writes</li><li>Send data change events to followers</li></ul><p>Reads can be from any replica, but may be stale from followers.</p><p><i>(Reference: Leaders and Followers, p. 152)</i></p>"
"What is the key challenge with asynchronous replication?";"<p>The key challenge with asynchronous replication is that recently committed data may be lost if an asynchronously updated follower becomes the new leader after a failure.</p><p><i>(Reference: Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Replication, p. 153-155)</i></p>"
"What is the quorum condition for reads and writes in a leaderless system with n replicas?";"<p>The quorum condition for reads and writes in a leaderless system with n replicas is:</p><p>w + r > n</p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>w is the number of write acknowledgments</li><li>r is the number of nodes queried for a read</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Quorums for Reading and Writing, p. 179-180)</i></p>"
"What is read-after-write consistency?";"<p>Read-after-write consistency ensures that users always see their own updates when reloading a page.</p><p><i>(Reference: Reading Your Own Writes, p. 162-163)</i></p>"
"What is the purpose of version vectors in leaderless replication?";"<p>The purpose of version vectors in leaderless replication is to:</p><ul><li>Track causal dependencies between data versions</li><li>Distinguish overwrites from concurrent writes</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Version vectors, p. 191)</i></p>"
"What are siblings in the context of leaderless databases?";"<p>In the context of leaderless databases, siblings are:</p><p>Conflicting data versions from concurrent writes that may need merging by the application.</p><p><i>(Reference: Detecting Concurrent Writes, p. 190)</i></p>"
"What is the 'last write wins' (LWW) conflict resolution strategy?";"<p>The 'last write wins' (LWW) conflict resolution strategy:</p><ul><li>Resolves conflicts by choosing the write with the latest timestamp</li><li>Risks data loss</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Last write wins (discarding concurrent writes), p. 186)</i></p>"
"What is hinted handoff in the context of sloppy quorums?";"<p>Hinted handoff in the context of sloppy quorums is:</p><ul><li>Temporary storage of writes for unavailable nodes</li><li>Forwarding of stored writes when the unavailable node recovers</li></ul><p><i>(Reference: Sloppy Quorums and Hinted Handoff, p. 183-184)</i></p>"
